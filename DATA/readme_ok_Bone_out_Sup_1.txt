Summary of the Content

The dataset provides detailed measurements of the distal humerus for a variety of mammal species. These measurements include the length, maximum radius, minimum radius, average radius, and width of the distal humerus. The data is used to analyze the allometry of these dimensions in relation to the body mass of the animals. This analysis helps in understanding how the size and shape of bones scale with the body size of the animals, which is crucial for studying biomechanics and evolutionary adaptations.

The dataset includes species from various taxonomic orders and families, providing a broad representation of mammals. The measurements are essential for comparative studies and for understanding the functional morphology of the humerus in relation to locomotion and other ecological adaptations.

The references to the mass data and other sources ensure the reliability and validity of the measurements, making this dataset a valuable resource for researchers in the fields of biology, paleontology, and biomechanics.
